# DRAFTING---21-REV.-ENG.-PROJECT

Reverse engineering is a systematic  design of an existing device or equipment. It can be used as a means to study the design, and understand the device mechanics. Reverse engineering is used to gain information about the functionality and sizes of existing design components. It helps students and designers determining “how something works” is not stealing someone’s ideas, but rather is a beneficial way to enhance the learning process of engineering design for students and engineers/ designers.


The attached represents my Reverse Engineering Project for my drafting class at Chaffey College. My reverse engineering project is a 3-D Parts File of a Cork Screw that I generated using Solid Works Program. This project is the final project of our Drafting-21 Class, which will be completed in May 20022. All parts where carefully scaled using a Electronic Digital Caliper. Measurements where taken from an acutal Cork Screw purchased for $1.59 at Doller Tree Stores. Many of the parts are plastic with the cork screw worm and hardware made of stainless steel. A short animation will show the part in an exploded version. 

​

The first part of our Reverse Engineering project required selecting a functioning piece of equipment that had more than (5) parts and (2) parts that require motion. Once the equipment was selected. The Cork Screw was taken apart and carefully measure to scale in inches. Each part was then drafted on Solid Works until all parts where complete and assmebled on SolidWorks.
