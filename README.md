# DRAFTING---21-REV.-ENG.-PROJECT
The above image represents my Reverse Engineering Project for my drafting class at Chaffey College. My reverse engineering project is a 3-D Parts File of a Cork Screw that I generated using Solid Works Program. This project is the final project of our Drafting-21 Class, which will be completed in May 20022. All parts where carefully scaled using a Electronic Digital Caliper. Measurements where taken from an acutal Cork Screw purchased for $1.59 at Doller Tree Stores. Many of the parts are plastic with the cork screw worm and hardware made of stainless steel. A short animation will show the part in an exploded version. 

​

The first part of our Reverse Engineering project required selecting a functioning piece of equipment that had more than (5) parts and (2) parts that require motion. Once the equipment was selected. The Cork Screw was taken apart and carefully measure to scale in inches. Each part was then drafted on Solid Works until all parts where complete and assmebled on SolidWorks. 

​

This project represents all the skill and knowledge needed to build an object or piece of equipment using the SolidWorks program. The project is consistant with real life project that everyday engineers deal with. The end goal of this project is to show case the skills learned throughout the course and show proper use of the SolidWorks program, so that students can begin usuing those skill and applying them to real life projects.
